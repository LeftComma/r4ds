### 1. Practice what you’ve learned by creating a brief CV. The title should be your name, and you should include headings for (at least) education or employment. Each of the sections should include a bulleted list of jobs/degrees. Highlight the year in bold.

## Employment
### Research Assistant, UoY Dep of Psychology - **Summer 2019**
*	Oversaw data collection in an experiment for one of Dr Barraclough’s PhD students.
*	Set-up the equipment, organised the participants and recorded the data.
*	Learnt about experimental design in an unfamiliar area of psychology: emotional responses to music. 
*	Enjoyed getting to grips with different ways of undertaking research, and the specific equipment and programs used to record subjective and physical responses.
*	Worked well with the participants, helping them to understand the experiment, solved problems that arose and ensured they had an enjoyable experience. This involved being friendly, helpful, and capable.

### Chalet Host, Ski Beat - **Winter 2017/8**
*	Managed a chalet of 11 guests single-handedly, operating independently on a day-to-day basis. This involved being highly self-motivated, whilst also operating flexibly within the larger team in the resort. I learnt how to coordinate well with colleagues whilst being responsible for my own chalet without needing constant supervision.
*	Dealt with guest’s queries and issues, developing my skills as an active listener and communicator.
*	Planned, ordered, cooked, and served meals, which required excellent time management and organisation skills. I embraced challenging situations like cooking Christmas dinner for 12 while accommodating three separate food allergies.
*	Learnt how to work under intense conditions and adapt quickly and effectively to changing circumstances e.g., snowstorms delaying food delivery.

## 2. Using the R Markdown quick reference, figure out how to:
### A) Add a footnote

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.[^quick-fox]

### B) Add a horizontal rule

---

### C) Add a block quote
> Life is a journey. Time is a river. The door is ajar
>
> --- Harry Dresden


[^quick-fox]: This is an example of a footnote. The sentence this is footnoting
  is often used for displaying fonts because it includes all 26 letters of the
  English alphabet.

## 3. Copy and paste the contents of diamond-sizes.Rmd from https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/tree/master/rmarkdown in to a local R markdown document. Check that you can run it, then add text after the frequency polygon that describes its most striking features

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
smaller <- diamonds |> 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only 
`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than
2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller |> 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```

The most striking thing about the graph is how many diamonds are given round(ish) carats, clustered around common fractions like 0.5
